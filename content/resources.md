# Resources

Looking for other ways to improve your programming or just to learn something new?
We collected a list of resources that can help you on your journey.
The following content was and is continuously inspired by our Café colleagues from [VU](https://ubvu.github.io/bytes-and-bites/learning_files/resources.html) and the [Awesome research software training list](https://codeberg.org/open-science-roadmaps/awesome-research-software-training).

## Books and Papers on Programming

- [**Guide for Reproducible Coding**](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/reproducible-research/) This guide gives insights into version control, licensing, and code documentation and can help you to improve the reproducibility of your research project!
- [**Paper on good enough practices for scientific programming**](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) and [the fitting lesson on this topic from the Carepentries](https://carpentries-lab.github.io/good-enough-practices/03-software.html) These resources can help you to better structure your project and good practices right from the start.
- [**The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python**](https://docs.python-guide.org) This handbook covers a wide range of Python-related topics.
- [**What They Forgot to Teach You About R**](https://rstats.wtf) Interesting R content that goes beyond data analysis.
- [**Book about Computational Thinking for Social Scientists**](https://jaeyk.github.io/comp_thinking_social_science/) This website is designed to help social science researchers to learn how to think computationally.

## Workshops

### Within EUR
- **Data Carpentries for Social Sciences and Humanities** This course gives an introduction to R and nice tools such as OpenRefine. If you are an R beginner, attending this course is recommended. The next session will be in March 2026.
- **Introduction to Python for Researchers** In January this course will give you an introduction to Programming Fundamentals using Python. 

### National level
- [**Netherlands eScience center**](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/digital-skills/) The eScience center regularly offers intermediate programming courses for researchers and support staff
