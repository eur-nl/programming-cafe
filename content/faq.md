## 1. Who is it for?

The programming café is for researchers of all levels of programming, regardless of their field of study or level of experience. 
- Beginner programmers can find a supportive environment that will connect you with like-minded, but also help you learn how to code and get the help they need. 
- Advanced programmers can share their expertise and connect with other skilled programmers to stay up-to-date with the latest trends. 
- Interdisciplinary researchers can find a supportive and collaborative environment here where they can learn programming skills that are relevant to their research
- Data specialists can find a platform to connect with other researchers who share their interest, learn from each other and collaborate on data-driven research projects here

## 2. Why should I invest my time?

Programming can be a daunting task, especially when you are just starting out, but it does not have to be a lonely one. If you help us building the community, we can support each other, learn from each other and grow together.

## 3. Will there be food?

We will try to always provide some source of food for the lunch breaks. However, you can also bring your own lunch with you!

## 4. I am a Bachelor/Master student. Can I attend?

As we are just starting this initiative, we want to focus on researchers (PhDs, Postdocs, profs, etc.) in the beginning.

## 5. I have an idea for a session, but I would not like to present it myself. 

We are happy for any ideas and suggestions! If you flag an interest topic to us, we can find a speaker at EUR or different institutions. 

## 6. I have a pesky bug and just do not know how to solve it. Can I have 1:1 consultation?

As of now, our research software trainers are not offering 1:1 support. However, if you approach us during/after the Programming Café, we can discuss the bug with you and have a look at it! Who knows, maybe some of your colleagues ran into the same bug before and know the solution to it already!
