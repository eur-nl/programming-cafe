<p>

### The new academic year just began, and we are coming with some exciting news!

We will host our first programming café on 18th of November at 11:00 (until 13:00) in Mandeville T3-13.
<br>
#### What can you expect?
Our first Café (Code along, feel empowered) will be hosted together with support staff from the [Programming Café project](https://tdcc.nl/projects/tdcc-nes-projects/the-cafe-code-along-feel-empowered-method/). Together with them (and you), we will kickstart a new national initiative of programming cafés.

#### Topic
The topic of the first session will be "How to approach programming as a Researcher". We will focus on best practices in how to start thinking like a computer, how to structure your folder and your code and get a glimpse on best programming practices. After the initial presentation, you have time to ask question.
The second part of the Café is designed to help you with your projects! Any question in regard to how to use the learned knowledge for your own code? Struggling with a bug? Need some brainstorming with colleagues? We got your back!

### Preparation
Bring your own laptop!

### Extras
As part of the kickstart of the new national initiative, we will offer food and drinks! Come and enjoy your lunchbreak with us.

### Prior meeting keeps you from joining at 11:00?
No problem! Join us after your meeting and we will bring you up-to-date. We will also upload the material after the session.
